<h2>About this Version</h2>

<p>
  The major diffrence brought by this version (1.5) is the development and
  integration of HeapInspector. It allows to obtains dynamically information
  about the JVM heap at the initialization (before the real execution of the
  program). Theses information could then be used by Sawja analysis. As example
  an RTA analysis using the information from this initial heap is provided
  (RTAWithHeap). The new version of Nit can also benefit from these feature to
  provide more accurate result. Subtyping functionality have also been included
  in this version. You can obtain the detail of the changes in the CHANGELOG
  file.
